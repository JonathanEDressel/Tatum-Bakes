# Tatum-Bakes
My wife's baking website. Simple MERN stack website for her business. 

# To-Do:
- Setup UI for the pages
- Add images for pages needed
- Figure out if I need backend at all
- Add securities for .env variables (not sure if needed or not. Needs further research)
- Add rate limiting to email service
- ~~Add email service~~
- ~~Create UI for Contact page~~
- ~~Add image templates to test out UI for Home page~~

# Dev Personal Notes
5/5/2025 - I'm not user I'll need the backend. Seems pointless to have for now but I haven't deleted it out of percaution that there will be a case for it. Also, rate limiting needs to be added and maybe add some other minor security percautions with .env vairables. The below article seems helpful with the .env problem. I'll check it out when I have time.
